# Databases Basics - MS SQL Server

Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern applications, making them an indispensable part of almost every single application.
The Intensive database basics will introduce you to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems-Microsoft SQL Server. The course pays serious attention to the relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational links) and the SQL work language (data extraction, selection, projection, compounds, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Basic knowledge of ACID transactions and transactional processing and practical tips for adjusting performance is provided.
This course lays the foundations of working with databases, making it easier to use them in real applications and understanding concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).

#Databases Advanced - Entity Framework

We will consider in detail the work with a modern ORM technology: Entity Framework (EF), which is the practice standard for ORM in C# and .net applications. EF allows mapping between relational base and object-oriented model through the "Database First" and "code first" approaches and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations. We will demonstrate established practices in building a database layer of complex systems through the templates  "Repository " and "Unit of Work". 
During the course will be developed a practical team project, which includes practical use of different DB servers (SQL Server, MySQL), platforms and data access technologies (ADO.NET, Entity Framework and others) and import and export to various formats for Data (JSON, XML). 
The course is part of the overall program with C# courses and training lessons by profession  "C# programmer " at the Software University.
